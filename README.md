# Recurrent Neural Networks for Time-Series Forecasting: From Theory to Real-World Application
## üìç Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building and optimizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for time-series forecasting. The work progresses from foundational concepts using a synthetic dataset to solving a real-world business problem. It highlights key skills in model design, optimization, and performance evaluation.

## üìö Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Understanding and implementing the fundamentals of RNNs to process sequential data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Applying an advanced RNN architecture to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies in real-world time-series data.

Time-Series Analysis: Handling and preprocessing time-series data, including normalization, creating sequences for supervised learning, and making predictions.

Model Optimization: Iteratively redesigning a neural network to improve performance, a critical skill for real-world machine learning projects.

Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to quantitatively assess and compare model performance.

## üìä Project Walkthrough & Outcomes
### Part 1: RNN Fundamentals with Synthetic Data
Objective: To build and train a basic RNN to predict a sine wave.

Process:

A simple sine wave dataset was generated programmatically.

An initial RNN model was trained, establishing a baseline for prediction.

Outcome: The model successfully learned the sequential pattern of the sine wave, as seen in the visualization of the predicted vs. actual wave. This confirms a solid understanding of how RNNs handle sequence data.

### Part 2: Applying LSTM to Real-World Data
Objective: To apply a more powerful LSTM model to a real-world problem: sales forecasting using the Superstore Sales Dataset.

Process:

The model was trained on historical sales data.

Initial predictions were made, and performance was evaluated with validation loss.

Outcome: The initial LSTM model was able to capture trends and seasonality, but its performance could be improved.

### Part 3: Model Redesign and Optimization
Objective: To improve the LSTM model's performance by redesigning its architecture and tuning its parameters.

Process:

An additional LSTM layer was added to increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.

Dropout regularization was implemented to mitigate overfitting.

Key parameters like batch size and learning rate were tuned.

Outcome: The redesigned model demonstrated significant improvements, as detailed in the final project presentation.
